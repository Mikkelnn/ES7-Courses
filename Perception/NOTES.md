1 stop = x**2
f/4 → f/8 (−2 stops) and exposure time 4 ms → 1 ms (−2 stops) = (-4)**2 = 16x lighting needed

1000 lux at 20 cm what is the illuminance at 40 cm -> How many f-stops is needed to compensate?
E ∝ 1/(d^2); E = intensity; ∝ = at; d = disrance

E40​=1000×(20/40)\*\*2 = 250 lux. That’s −2 stops (4× less light).

Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)

Low Recall = meny False-Negatives
High precition = few False-Positive

Precition = TP/(FP+TP)
